<approach>
<step>
### Phase 1: Checklist Discovery and Analysis
- Use the github mcp server:
  - Use `npm run git:info` for information regarding the repository and issue.
  - Fetch issue using `mcp__github__get_issue`
  - Extract existing `<!-- START: CHECKLIST --> <content> <!-- END: CHECKLIST -->` content from the github issue
  - Filter for items with `expert: js or/and scss or/and css`
  - From now on only work with these checklist item and nothing else in the ticket
  - Terminate immediately if no of these expert tasks exist
  
- Read and understand each JavaScript/SCSS-related checklist item thoroughly, including:
  - Interactive functionality requirements
  - Styling and animation needs
  - Performance considerations
  - User experience enhancements
  - Integration with Liquid templates (if needed)

- Output:
  - Confirmation of the JavaScript/SCSS tasks found
  - Brief summary of the interactive features to implement
  - Your understanding of the styling requirements

- Write a comprehensive Todo-List by using the tool `TodoWrite` based on all filtered CHECKLIST items and according to the phase 2 steps
</step>

<step>
### Phase 2: Iterative Implementation

For each checklist item within <content> which requests JavaScript/SCSS, follow this precise procedure:

1. **Pre-Implementation Research**:
   - Analyze existing codebase for:
     - Current JavaScript patterns and utilities
     - SCSS architecture and variables
     - Webpack configuration specifics
   - Take into account any `hints` section in the cheklist item
   - Plan the implementation approach
   - Output your implementation plan for this specific step

2. **Step Implementation**:
   - Implement the JavaScript functionality in compliance with the liquid codebase:
     - Create modular, reusable components
     - Handle all edge cases and errors
     - Ensure smooth user experience
     - Add loading states and feedback
     - Include proper event listeners and cleanup
     - Implement graceful degradation
   - Implement the SCSS styling in compliance with the liquid codebase:
     - Follow existing design patterns
     - Ensure responsive behavior
     - Create smooth animations
     - Maintain consistency
     - Use proper CSS architecture
     - Optimize for performance
   - Modify Liquid only when necessary for JS/SCSS functionality
   - Ensure webpack builds successfully after changes

3. **Implementation Quality Checks**:
   - Verify code follows project patterns
   - Check for proper error handling
   - Ensure loading states are implemented
   - Validate responsive behavior in code
   - Confirm webpack compilation success
   - Review code for performance optimizations
</step>

<step>
### Phase 3: Final Implementation Summary
- Review all completed JavaScript/SCSS checklist items
- Create comprehensive summary of:
  - All implemented features
  - JavaScript modules created/modified
  - SCSS files added/updated
  - Any Liquid template changes made
  - Webpack configuration updates (if any)
- Ensure all code is properly documented
- Verify webpack builds successfully
- Prepare handoff for testing phase
</step>
</approach>

### Do's
- Focus on smooth, performant interactions
- Create reusable JavaScript modules
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Build responsive, accessible interfaces
- Use modern JavaScript and CSS features
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Use the provided notification system if needed
- Document complex logic clearly

### Don'ts
- Don't write anything to the github issue
- Don't create Liquid templates (unless necessary for JS/SCSS)
- Don't modify HTML structure (unless required for JS/SCSS)
- Don't skip performance optimization
- Don't forget loading states and user feedback
- Don't ignore browser compatibility
- Do not run ANY tests. Not e2e tests nor unit tests. This is done at a later step.
- Do not test your results via browser tools like playwright. This is done at a later step.
